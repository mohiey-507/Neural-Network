losses.py

A collection of loss functions and their gradients for use in neural networks.

This module includes a class that provides static methods for various loss functions,
such as Mean Squared Error, Binary Cross-Entropy, and Categorical Cross-Entropy.
These loss functions are essential for training neural networks, allowing them to measure
the difference between predicted and actual values and guide the optimization process.

Usage:
    To use this module, import the Loss class and call the desired loss function 
    or its gradient as a static method. For example:

        import loss
        mse = loss.Loss.mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
"""

import numpy as np

class Loss:
    """
    A collection of loss functions and their gradients for use in neural networks.

    This class provides static methods for computing common loss functions 
    and their derivatives. These functions are crucial in training models 
    by providing a measure of the error between predicted and actual outputs.

    Methods:
        mean_squared_error(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> float:
            Computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

        mean_squared_error_derivative(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
            Computes the derivative of the MSE loss.

        binary_cross_entropy(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> float:
            Computes the Binary Cross-Entropy loss.

        binary_cross_entropy_gradient(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
            Computes the derivative of the Binary Cross-Entropy loss.

        categorical_cross_entropy(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> float:
            Computes the Categorical Cross-Entropy loss.

        categorical_cross_entropy_gradient(y_true: np.ndarray, y_pred: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
