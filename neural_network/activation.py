activation.py

A collection of activation functions and their gradients for use in neural networks.

This module includes a class that provides static methods for common activation functions, 
including sigmoid, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and hyperbolic tangent (tanh). 
These functions, along with their gradients, are essential for introducing 
non-linearity into neural networks, allowing them to learn complex patterns 
and make more accurate predictions.

Usage:
    To use this module, import the Activation class and call the desired activation 
    function or its gradient as a static method. For example:

        import activation
        output = activation.Activation.sigmoid(input_array)

Functions include:
- Activation.sigmoid
- Activation.sigmoid_gradient
- Activation.relu
- Activation.relu_gradient
- Activation.tanh
- Activation.tanh_gradient
- Activation.softmax
- Activation.softmax_gradient
